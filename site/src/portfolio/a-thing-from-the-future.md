The Thing from The Future was a digital art piece we had to complete as a part of our very first portfolio project. Restricted to following the guide of only the words: Transform, Space, Plant, and Surprise, I decided to move in a direction that amalgamated the themes of sweetness we associate with flowers and the themes of trepidation that come from space travel and human advancement. This idea birthed a minor portfolio of three inspired pieces, two of which can be seen below. This was one of my first attempts using Adobe Photoshop to create something artistic in nature.
