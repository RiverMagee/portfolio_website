This is an example of an independent project I collaberated on during my freshman year. I wanted to learn and explore the application of Python as it related to cyber-security using the Fernet library. I completed extensive research about topics relating to asymmetric encryption, public and private key access, 256-bit encryption, etc.

Here is the link to the Github to check it out: [Cyber Security Using Fernet](https://github.com/RiverMagee/Cyber-Security-Using-Fernet)
