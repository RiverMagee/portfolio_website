For my final project in digital art, I explored video game pixel art through Adobe Photoshop. This involved the creation of a couple, well-polished, characters using pixel art as my stylistic guide, with the ultimate goal to create a series of animated characters that could be playable in a hypothetical video game. The additional software used included Pygame, a python library used for game development. This will allowed me to create an interactive and animated experience with my art while focusing the vast majority of my time on my artwork. My final output includes three complete and well-designed characters, each with unique movement animations: idle, moving, flying, jumping, etc. Additionally, I created a simple but visually interesting environment in which my users can see these movement animations in action. All of this will is contained within a GitHub repository that is publicly accessible and downloadable for those who want to see my artwork on their personal computers.
